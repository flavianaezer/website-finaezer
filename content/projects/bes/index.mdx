#### Watercolor & Ink on Paper, 20x30cm, 2021, For Sale (25 euros)

We met Bes at the summer vacation house in Oisterwijk in 2021. Bes is a very sweet, slightly older and an extremely calm dog; a German shepherd with shorter legs. He likes to sleep a lot and often visits the kitchen during dinnertime.
