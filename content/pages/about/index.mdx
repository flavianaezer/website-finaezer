# Hello :-)

My name is Fi Naezer and I love to paint. I've loved drawing and painting since I was a little girl - making greeting cards, posters for the school, decorating classrooms with drawings gave me a lot of joy. And it still does! After all these years I have kept in touch with my artistic side. I enjoy different forms of art and draw inspiration from great artists like Monet, Van Gogh, and Escher; like to use different materials like oil, watercolors, batik to create artworks that you find on this website. I enjoy capturing nature; flowers being my favorite. These are generally flowers I grew myself; and this way I connect art with my other hobby 'gardening'!

Welcome to my website, happy you're here! Please have a look and I hope some of it connects, engages or inspires with your world.

## Commissioning artwork
Say you want to commission a new piece, made exclusively for you: it could be something specific, for a special occassion or even a memory. Please drop me an [e-mail](mailto:hello@flavias.nl) with your wishes and ideas. This typically is a longer journey of understanding and uncovering your desires, expectations and capturing it into an artwork just for you.
