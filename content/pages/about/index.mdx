# Hello :-)

I'm Flavia Naezer and I love to paint. I've loved drawing and painting ever since I was a little girl. At school, I took extra drawing classes and participated in various drawing competitions. I made a portrait Galileo, the great scientist, which hangs in our Science lab still. Since couple of years, I've resumed my hobby and joined an art class in the neighborhood. Here I learn different techniques, and through the process of trying them out, I have built my own art portfolio.
Welcome to my website! 
You can view all my artwork here. A part of it, marked as "Private Collection", is displayed at my home, or at friends / family, and the remainder is up "For Sale". I also create artwork on commission.

## Buying artwork
You can buy items from the "For Sale" section (or artwork marked as such).
When you're interested to buy an artwork, drop me an [e-mail](mailto:hello@flavias.nl).
        
## Commissioning artwork
Say you want to commission a new piece, made exclusively for you. Please drop me an [e-mail](mailto:hello@flavias.nl) with your wishes and ideas. And let's take it from there.
