# Hello :-)

I'm Flavia Naezer and I love to paint. I've loved drawing and painting ever since I was a little girl. At school, I took extra drawing classes and participated in various drawing competitions. I made a portrait Galileo, the great scientist, which hangs in our Science lab still. Since couple of years, I've resumed my hobby and joined an art class in the neighborhood. Here I learn different techniques, and through the process of trying them out, I have built my own art portfolio.
Welcome to my website, happy you're here!
You can view all my artwork here. A part of it, marked as "Private Collection", is displayed at my home, or at friends / family, and the rest is up "For Sale". I also create artwork on commission, so if you're looking for something special and specific, do drop by.

## Buying artwork
The "For Sale" section and artwork marked as such are for sale.
When you're interested to buy an artwork, drop me an [e-mail](mailto:hello@flavias.nl).
        
## Commissioning artwork
Say you want to commission a new piece, made exclusively for you: it could be something specific, for a special occassion or even a memory. I can create artpieces with various techniques. Please drop me an [e-mail](mailto:hello@flavias.nl) with your wishes and ideas. And let's take it from there.
